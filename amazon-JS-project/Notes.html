    /*
    Main Idea of J:
    1. Save the data
    2. Generate the HTML
    3. Make it interactive
    
    const products= [];
    Here we used variable prdodcuts to save the information about products and we are using objects to store various information about product such as image, description, rating etc.,
    */

    /* We initiated  a variable called productsHTML to combine html together and to put it on web page we are using DOM */

    /* When we click on add to cart button then that product should go to cart page for that we created cart.js in data folder
    
    How do we knw which product to add?
     
    Data attribte:
    -is just anoother HTML attribute
    - allows us to attach any information to an element
Syntax:
      In Html after giving class use "data-anyname="${productname}""  
  Syntax rules for data attribute:
  - its just an HTML attribute
  - data attribute should start with data- and name on left and value on right -- see syntax above
    
    */

    /* dataset property gives us all the data attributes attached to the button*/

    /* Here we pushed into cart variable in cart.js. Here we sucessfully added products into cart. But if we are clicking on the same add to cart button it showing quantty 1 insted of 2 for example: if we added basketfall into cart it shows quantity to 1 but agan if we added basket ball it again shows quantity 1 but in different array. To overcome this:
    Steps: 1. Check if the product is already in the cart
    2. If it is in the cart, increase the qunatity.
    3. It its not in the cart add it to the cart */
